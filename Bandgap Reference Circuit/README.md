# Band-Gap-Reference
A temperature-independent stable voltage source (BGR) designed in Cadence 

BGR consists of two parts: PTAT & CTAT

The key idea of Band Gap Reference is to combine two voltages with opposite temperature coefficients, so that they cancel each other out & we get a moderately stable voltage.

## CTAT
1. Stands for 'Complementary to Absolute Temperature'
2. As temperature increases, voltage will decrease
3. This is due to the fact that in an NPN diode, current is a strong function of temperature, but voltage, on the other hand, is a weak function of temperature



## PTAT
1. Stands for 'Proportional To Absolute Temperature'
2. As temperature increases, voltage (or current) also increases
